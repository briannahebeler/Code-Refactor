# Homework01-Code-Refactor

## description ##

In this project my goal was to refactor the clients codebase to follow accessibilty standards outlined. 

I cleaned up the HTLM structure while replacing many tags with semantic tags, adding alt attributes, and tweeked content such as the title, and broken links. 

I cleaned the CSS page by reordering all the items to match the sequential order and the new tags on the HTML page. I also condensed classes, got rid of obsolete code, and altered CSS code to match the demo.##
